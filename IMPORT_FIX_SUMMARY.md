# Import Issues Fixed

## Problem
The main conversion script `convert_totalsegmentator.py` was trying to import `create_totalsegmentator_model` from `src.models`, but the `models.py` file was missing.

## Solution

1. **Created `src/models.py`** - This file now contains:
   - `UNet3D`: Full U-Net architecture for the main body model (104 classes)
   - `CompactUNet3D`: Smaller U-Net for specialized models (fewer classes)
   - `create_totalsegmentator_model()`: Factory function to create appropriate model
   - `load_pretrained_model()`: Helper to load pretrained weights

2. **Updated `src/__init__.py`** - Added imports for:
   - `create_totalsegmentator_model`
   - `load_pretrained_model`

3. **Fixed `setup.py`** - Removed incorrect package configuration that was causing import issues

├── convert_totalsegmentator.py    # Main conversion script
├── setup.py                        # Package setup
├── requirements.txt                # Dependencies
├── test_imports.py                 # Import verification script
└── src/
    ├── __init__.py                 # Package initialization
    ├── converter.py                # Core conversion logic

```

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Verify imports work:
   ```bash
   python test_imports.py
   ```

3. Run the conversion:
   ```bash
   python convert_totalsegmentator.py --help
   ```

## Model Architecture Notes

The created models match TotalSegmentator's architecture:
- **Body model**: 5-level U-Net with 32-512 features for 104 organ classes
- **Specialized models**: 4-level compact U-Net with 16-128 features for 2-6 classes
- All models use 3D convolutions for volumetric CT data
- Includes proper skip connections and BatchNorm for stability
